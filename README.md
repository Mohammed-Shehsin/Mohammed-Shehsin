# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohammed Shehsin Thamarachalil Abdulresak

**Robotics & Automation Engineer**  
B.Sc. Automatic Control & Robotics — Poznań University of Technology (2026)

I build real robotic systems — from mechanical design and embedded control to ROS 2 simulation and industrial PLC integration.  
My focus is manipulators, motion control pipelines, and robot–PLC communication architectures.
